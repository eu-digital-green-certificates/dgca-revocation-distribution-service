## About

This distribution service distributes the revocation list data gathered by the EU DCC Gateway to the DCCA Verifier Apps 
to check the revocation status. The Service currently supports two formats of providing the revocation data. Namely, these are 
the Hashfilter and Bloomfilter implementations. Other distribution formats can be integrated, if wished, by implementing the SliceCalculation interface.

## Development

The installation of the revocation service requires an already preinstalled postgres database. The tables, views etc. will than be created via liquibase.
If you run the service locally with the provided docker compose file, a pod with a postgres db will be created automatically.

### Prerequisites

- OpenJDK 11 (with installed ```keytool``` CLI)
- Maven
- Keys to access the [DGCG](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway) via the
    [DGCG Connector](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-lib) of the [DGC-lib](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-lib)
- Authenticate to [Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry)

#### Needed keys for accessing the DGC Gateway
<p id="access-keys"></p>
For accessing the DGC Gateway via the DGC Connector you need the following keys in place:

- The public key of the used Gateway. The public key should be stored in the *tls_trust_store*. If you use one of the
  provided gateways, you will get the public key as .pem from DIGIT. This .pem needs to be converted into pkcs12 format:
  ````
  openssl pkcs12 -export -in pub_tls.pem -name trust -out tls_trust_store.p12
  ````
- Your key pair for accessing the Gateway stored in *tls_key_store*. This needs to be generated by yourself and then whitelisted by operations team (see [onboarding manual](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-participating-countries/blob/main/gateway/OnboardingChecklist.md) of the Gateway). To use it in the verifier service this needs to be converted as well into pkcs12 format:
  ````
  openssl pkcs12 -export -in tls.pem -inkey tls_private.pem -name 1 -out tls_key_store.p12
  ````

- The public key of the TrustAnchor of the Gateway. If you use one of the provided Gateways you will get it as well, at onboarding. The key should be stored in a jks file.

For more information on how to generate certificates for DGC Gateway and how to run your own local one, please have a look in the documentation of the [Gateway](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway).


#### Authenticating to GitHub Packages

As some of the required libraries (and/or versions are pinned/available only from GitHub Packages) You need to authenticate
to [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry)
The following steps need to be followed

- Create [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with scopes:
- `read:packages` for downloading packages

##### GitHub Maven

- Copy/Augment `~/.m2/settings.xml` with the contents of `settings.xml` present in this repository
- Replace `${app.packages.username}` with your github username
- Replace `${app.packages.password}` with the generated PAT

##### GitHub Docker Registry

- Run `docker login docker.pkg.github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates` before running further docker commands.
- Use your GitHub username as username
- Use the generated PAT as password


### Build

Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory
or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described
afterwards depending on the way you choose.

#### Build with maven
Building this project is done with maven.

* Check [settings.xml](settings.xml) in the root folder of this git repository as example.  
  Copy the servers to your own `~/.m2/settings.xml` in order to connect the GitHub repositories we use in our code. Provide your GitHub username and access token (see [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)) under the variables suggested.

* Run the following command from the project root folder
```shell
mvn clean install
```
All required dependencies will be downloaded, the project build and the artifact stored in your local repository.

#### Run with docker
* Perform maven build as described above
* Place the keys and certificates named [above](#access-keys) into the ***certs*** folder.
* Adjust the values in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file to fit the url for the gateway you use and
  your keys and certificates you have to access it.
  ```yaml
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_ENDPOINT=https://dgc-gateway.example.com
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSTRUSTSTORE_PATH=file:/ec/prod/app/san/dgc/tls_trust_store.p12
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSTRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=dgcg-p4ssw0rd
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSKEYSTORE_ALIAS=1
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSKEYSTORE_PATH=file:/ec/prod/app/san/dgc/tls_key_store.p12
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSKEYSTORE_PASSWORD=dgcg-p4ssw0rd
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TRUSTANCHOR_ALIAS=ta
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TRUSTANCHOR_PATH=file:/ec/prod/app/san/dgc/trust_anchor.jks
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TRUSTANCHOR_PASSWORD=dgcg-p4ssw0rd
  ```
***Note:*** Leave the path as is and only change the file names, as the ***certs*** folder will be mapped to this folder inside the docker container.

* Run the following command from the project root folder

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

After all containers have started, you will be able to reach the service on your [local machine](http://localhost:8080/api/docs) under port 8080.

## Settings

By default the service provides two representations of the revocation data. It is bloom filter and variable hash list. 
The boom filter is also set as the default representation if no special filter type is set in the request. This behavior can be adjusted by resetting or overwriting the values of the application.yaml
The following table describes the parameter and there effect:

| Parameter                | Description                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **dgc_revocationListDownload:** ||
| timeInterval | Sets the interval of how often the gateway should be checked for new revocation data. | 
| lockLimit | Determines how long the lock download should be kept, before it gets released. The lock ensures, that the data of the gateway is loaded only once at a time. If there are more than one instance.   
| downloadLimit | This value determines the max download time of one update interval, after this time the calculation of the filters is started.
| **defaultRevocationDataType** | Sets the filter type, that should be returned by default is none is set in the request. Possible values are BLOOMFILTER and VARHASHLIST
| **bloomFilter:**| |
| enabled | Determines if boomfilters should be calculated and available.
| probRate | Sets the probability rate of the filter.
| **varHashList:** | |
| enabled | Determines if boomfilters should be calculated and available.
| probRate | Sets the probability rate of the filter.
| minByteCount | Sets the minimum num of bytes each hash needs to have in the filter. |
